# ShardForge: Enterprise-Grade Distributed Database System

## Executive Summary

ShardForge is a next-generation distributed database system built entirely in Rust, designed to deliver PostgreSQL-compatible SQL, ACID transactions, and horizontal scalability through RAFT consensus and intelligent sharding. Unlike traditional databases built with legacy languages, ShardForge leverages Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency to deliver enterprise-grade performance and reliability.

The system is architected for the cloud-native era, with first-class support for Kubernetes, containerization, and modern DevOps practices. Starting with a developer-focused CLI experience, ShardForge evolves into a comprehensive platform for mission-critical applications requiring strong consistency, high availability, and global scale.
