# Performance Considerations

## 1. Benchmarking Targets

### Performance Goals (Year 1)

```text
Throughput:
- Reads: 100,000 QPS per node
- Writes: 50,000 QPS per node
- Mixed workload: 75,000 QPS per node

Latency (99th percentile):
- Point queries: <10ms
- Range queries: <50ms
- Transactions: <100ms

Scalability:
- Linear read scaling up to 32 nodes
- Write scaling efficiency: >80% up to 16 nodes
- Storage: 10TB per node, 100TB per cluster
```

## 2. Optimization Strategies

### Hot Path Optimizations

- **Zero-copy serialization** where possible
- **Connection pooling** for reduced overhead
- **Query result caching** with TTL
- **Prepared statement caching**
- **Batch operations** for bulk inserts/updates

### Memory Management

- **Custom allocators** for specific workloads
- **Memory pools** for frequently allocated objects
- **NUMA-aware** data placement
- **Transparent huge pages** support
