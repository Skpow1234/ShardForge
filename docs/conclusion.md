# Conclusion

Building a distributed database is an extremely ambitious project that will require significant time, expertise, and resources. However, Rust's performance characteristics and growing ecosystem make it an ideal choice for this type of systems software.

The CLI-first approach for the first year allows us to focus on core functionality while building a strong foundation for future GUI and web-based tools. The phased development approach ensures we can deliver value incrementally while building toward the full vision.

Success will depend on:

1. **Technical Excellence**: Correct, fast, reliable implementation
2. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and documentation
3. **Community Building**: Active open source community
4. **Market Timing**: Catching the wave of Rust adoption in infrastructure
