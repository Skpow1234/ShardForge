# Core Technologies Stack

## Programming Language & Runtime

```rust
// Core Rust version: 1.80.0+ (stable as of 2024)
edition = "2021"

// Recommended rustc flags for performance and security
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
strip = true

[profile.dev]
opt-level = 0
debug = true
overflow-checks = true
```

### Rust Ecosystem Considerations

- **Memory Safety**: Ownership system prevents data races and buffer overflows
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level code with low-level performance
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for scalable concurrent operations
- **Package Management**: Cargo for dependency resolution and building
- **Cross-Platform**: Native binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows

## Performance & Security Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

- **Link-Time Optimization (LTO)**: Enabled in release builds for better inlining
- **Codegen Units**: Set to 1 for maximum optimization
- **CPU-Specific Optimizations**: Target native CPU architecture
- **Memory Allocators**: Consider jemallocator or mimalloc for production

### Security Hardening

- **Binary Stripping**: Remove debug symbols from release builds
- **Stack Protection**: Enabled via rustc flags
- **Address Sanitization**: Available for debugging
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments

### Operational Considerations

- **Container Security**: Run as non-root user, minimal base images
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits in Kubernetes
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health endpoints
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling for zero-downtime updates

This technology stack provides a solid foundation for building a high-performance, secure, and maintainable distributed database system.
