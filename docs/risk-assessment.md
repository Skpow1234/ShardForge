# Risk Assessment

## Technical Risks

1. **Complexity**: Distributed systems are inherently complex
   - *Mitigation*: Start simple, iterative development

2. **Performance**: Meeting throughput/latency targets
   - *Mitigation*: Continuous benchmarking, profiling

3. **Correctness**: Ensuring ACID properties in distributed setting
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing, formal verification where possible

## Market Risks

1. **Competition**: Established players with resources
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on Rust ecosystem, developer experience

2. **Adoption**: Convincing enterprises to try new database
   - *Mitigation*: Open source, strong community engagement
